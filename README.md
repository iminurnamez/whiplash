#Build-A-Sprite

This challenge focuses on creating a tool to create and save sprite images for use in your games. The sprites are constructed from the 
sprite components created by opengameart user TokyoGeisha. The included code handles loading the images from the spritesheets or you
 are welcome to use your own implementation.
 
Github repo:

#Challenge

Create an app that allows the user to create a sprite image using the components found in the github repo (I combined the spritesheets from the different
 sprite sets, added recolored versions and reorganized the spritesheets to be more uniform). For each component (hair, eyes, tops, etc.), the user should
 be able to change the color and style as well as toggling whether that component is used at all. The user should also be able to save the sprites they create.
