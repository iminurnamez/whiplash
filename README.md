#Whiplash

Requires python and pygame

##How To Play

Use the mouse to control your "snake".

The goal is to score as many points as possible

Points are continuously earned when your snake is at full length
 (the snake is only colored when it's at full length)

The longer you can stay at full length, the higher your score multiplier will be

Colliding your snake with one of the mobs "snips" your snake at the point of collision and resets your score multiplier

If snipped, your snake will regenerate until it reaches its full length (at which point you'll start earning points again)

The game ends if your snake becomes too short (i.e., don't hit mobs with the "head" of your snake).
